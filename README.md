## Face Recognition
Face recognition is a biometric recognition technique. Biometric recognition is an information system that allows the identification of a person based on some of its main physiological and behavioral characteristics. Face recognition is a broad problem of identifying or verifying people in photographs and videos, a process comprised of detection, alignment, feature extraction, and a recognition task It has 4 steps which are :

1. Face Detection
2. Data Gathering
3. Data Comparison
4. Face Recognition

## About the project
This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

## Scope of the project
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also converts web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.
